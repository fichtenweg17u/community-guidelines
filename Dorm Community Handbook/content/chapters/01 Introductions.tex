Hey, you made it to the chapters! Let's start by introducing ourselves, shall we?

Hi, my name is Robin and I'm \myage{} years old. I am currently in my computer science master and work as a web developer besides that. Because of my work I am not always around in the dorm. Usually between the semesters I'll move to my hometown, since this is closer to my office. But during the lecture time you'll find me around!

If you want to find my, start looking in the kitchen ;) I love to cook for dinner and always appreciate some company, so if you're interested in joining some day, just react to my announcement in chat!

And one more thing: In my bachelors I lived in a flat, that's why I came here with a lot of household equipment. So if you are in need of something like a screwdriver or a vacuum, feel free to ask, maybe I can help!

I'm looking forward to meeting you!
