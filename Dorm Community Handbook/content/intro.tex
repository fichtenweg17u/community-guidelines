Hey there!

If you are a visitor and searching for WiFi, the place you are looking for is the kitchen! You will find a QR code in back by the speakers, that should cover your needs. And don't worry, I'm not mad if you skip the rest of this document ;).\\
If you are or want to become a part of our floor-community: This document is for you!

First of all: Thank you, for checking out our community handbook! Communication is the most important ingredient to a harmonizing community, and you have just made the first step!

Don't worry, this is not a pagelong contract you need to sign with blood and sell your soul to the devil. Quite the contrary actually! We are trying to build and maintain an open and respectful community with one primary rule:

\begin{displayquote}
    Just talk! :)
\end{displayquote}

Everyone is encuraged to speak their mind, bring new ideas, raise complaints or just chat and have fun! Of course in turn you are asked to have an open ear for the others and respect their wishes.

Unfortunately every community needs some place to dump all the organizational context, so that is what this document is for: A place to look up whom to ask, what to do or where to go for your needs!
